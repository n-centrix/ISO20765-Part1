ISO20765 Part 1 Equation of State (Also known as AGA8-92DC)

The AGA8-92DC equation was published in 1992 by the American Gas Association, having been designed specifically as a procedure for the high accuracy calculation of compression factor. In this respect, it is already the subject of ISO12213-2.

In order for the AGA8 equation to become useful for the calculation of all thermodynamic properties, the equation itself, published initially in a form explicit only for volumetric properties, was mathematically reformulated. This reformulation has been the subject of the ISO 20765-part I standard which specifies a method of calculation for the volumetric and caloric properties of natural gases based on the Helmholtz free energy.

Added isentropic temperature coefficient ISENCOEFT to the original set of derived properties.

ISENCOEFT=T / (T-1D3*P/(D* MOL*CP)-P*JTCOEF)

T: Temperature (K)
P: Pressure (MPa)
D * MOL: Density (kg/m3)   
Cp: Isobaric specific heat (kJ/(kg.K))
JTCOEF: Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient
